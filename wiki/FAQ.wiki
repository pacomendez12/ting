  # *Why isn't there a Thread::Kill() method?* Because it is a dirty way to terminate thread. Thread should terminate gracefully, freeing all its allocated resources. So, the correct way is to ask a thread to finish (for example, using inter-thread communication means like message queue or semaphore) and then wait for it to finish with Thread::Join() method.The Thread::Kill() is not provided to force programmers do the right way.
