=Creating a Thread=
first of all we need to include *sckt* header to use the library
{{{
#include <ting.hpp>
}}}

After that we can start using the library. To create a thread one needs to derive a new class representing her thread from ting::Thread base class and override its ting::Thread::Run() method
{{{
class MyThread : public ting::Thread{
public:
    //override
    void Run(){
        //do some thread acctions
    };
};
}}}
After we have our thread class defined we can create an object of this class and start the thread execution by calling ting::Thread::Start() method on it
{{{
MyThread thr; //create an object on the stack for simplicity
thr.Start();//start thread execution
}}}
After starting the thread we can wait for it to finish its execution by calling ting::Thread::Join() method on the thread object. After this call we can surely say that thread has finished its execution
{{{
thr.Join();
}}}
